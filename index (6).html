        <div class="subheading mb-5">Marketing Specialist</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Max Polk and I specialize in marketing all sorts of things. When I was a kid, I used to try and sell my toys to my parents, only to realize that neither of them wanted the toy dump truck they'd given me for Christmas. I started to move my market to the playground, where I sold my toys to my classmates for candy or other trinkets I felt had a higher value. Eventually I’d gotten so good at this that I could trade up a candy bar into a backpack by the end of the day. This is where I learned a few basic fundamentals of marketing that I still use today. Of course, as everyone under the age of twelve does, I set up lemonade stands. This is where I learned to really do business. Every Saturday, I would wake up early in the morning, pick fresh lemons from my aunt’s lemon tree, and make lemonade. I never watered down my lemonade. I made a good product that I knew people would like and stuck to that recipe. During the week, I went around town and stapled posters to wherever I could to advertise my lemonade stand. I would sell from noon to five in the afternoon all summer. As my business grew, I started to sell new things. I baked cookies, brownies, and slices of cake. However, the most important thing I learned was to sell myself. Putting my customers first was the most rewarding thing I could do. Making people happy was why I kept doing it. The money I made was definitely a plus, but I wouldn’t have kept my passion for marketing if it meant manipulating and hurting the people who supported me. The best part of all of this was that everyone felt like they had benefited from their exchanges.<br><br>

        As I got older, I started to see that the marketing world wasn’t something that I could admire. It seemed to me that everyone was just trying to sell bad products by lying and cutting short in product quality. Studying marketing and business in college, I began to see that most people are out to only benefit themselves. I can’t get behind that idea. That’s why I have made it my mission to uphold the highest levels of quality in all that I do professionally. I have sold a lot of products, but I have never sold a product that I didn’t believe would benefit my customers.<br><br>

        Those are my values that I forever vow to stay true to. I love people. I love interacting and speaking with people. I love being able to sell someone something that I know will improve their lives. Marketing is meant for me. Manipulation is a tool only used by those who aim to sell a bad product. The only thing I know is honesty. If I don’t think a product’s value matches up to its price, I’m not going to try and influence a person to spend their hard-earned money on it. This is me and this is what I do.
